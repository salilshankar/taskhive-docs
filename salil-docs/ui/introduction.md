# Introduction

TaskHive is a simple note taking web app for you. Use this app to quickly record your ideas and tasks so that you always have a hang of your ideas and work items.
It segregates tasks and notes under two sections, so that:
- You can quickly sift through tasks that need your attention, and 
- Notes where your ideas and points live for later reference.
